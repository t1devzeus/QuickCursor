### Fixing Permissions Issue:
If the application doesn't work after launching, you might need to give it permission to control your mouse and monitor your screen.

2. Scroll down to **Accessibility**, then click it. You should see **QuickCursor** listed. Turn the switch on.  
   - If **QuickCursor** is not listed, click the **+** button in the bottom-left corner, find the app, and add it.  
3. Next, go to **Input Monitoring** and repeat the same steps to enable QuickCursor.  
4. Restart **QuickCursor** to apply the changes.
